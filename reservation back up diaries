1- setting route 53: done annd waiting for aws support. 

2- dummy website: 
on ec2: installed httpd and started it and enaled it 
installed python 
installed flask (i have experience with it)

created another ec2 with mssql port for the db
installed mariadb , started it and enabled it 













dummy website will have ready records in the database
the only interaction between the system and the user is the query made by user to data base






ACM verification ways:
1. You Request a Certificate
You start by saying, “Hey ACM, I want a superhero badge (SSL/TLS certificate) for my domain!”
    • You log in to the AWS Management Console.
    • Go to the Certificate Manager and click Request a Certificate.
    • Enter your domain name (e.g., example.com).

2. Choose Your Verification Method
ACM needs to make sure you’re the real superhero for your domain. They offer two challenges:
Option 1: DNS Verification (Preferred)
This is like adding a magic phrase to your superhero book (DNS records):
    • ACM gives you a special magic phrase (a CNAME record).
    • You log in to your DNS manager (e.g., Route 53, GoDaddy, etc.).
    • Add the CNAME record ACM provided to your domain’s DNS settings.
Why DNS is Great:
    • It’s fast and doesn’t need to be updated every time you renew the certificate.
Option 2: Email Verification
This is like answering the superhero hotline:
    • ACM sends an email to certain official addresses for your domain (e.g., admin@example.com, webmaster@example.com).
    • You click the link in the email to verify ownership.
Why Email Is Okay:
    • It works if you don’t have access to DNS, but you’ll need to verify every time the certificate is renewed.
